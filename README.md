# UCLA Commencement Planning - Statistical Consulting
The COVID-19 pandemic has forced many campuses across the US to go virtual. UCLA is one of
the many universities that has opted to be primarily online. As a result, students are attending
classes at home, many even attending abroad. With the ongoing pandemic giving rise to health
concerns and students possessing differing travel and financial circumstances, the topic of holding
an in-person commencement ceremony has been a pressing and controversial issue. The goal of
our analysis is to explore the appropriate variables that would best predict student's perception of
exclusion should UCLA decide to hold an in-person ceremony.

The data used for this analysis is from the UCLA 2021 Senior Commencement survey (not available due to privacy reasons). Grad-
uating seniors at UCLA were surveyed on their graduation ceremony preferences and concerns in
early 2021 amidst the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic.
